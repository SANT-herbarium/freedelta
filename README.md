# Free DELTA
 An open source system for processing taxonomic descriptions based on the [DELTA â€“ DEscription Language for TAxonomy]() format.

The Free Delta Editor (FDE) is a cross-platform software package for editing [DELTA](http://delta-intkey.com/) data files and running DELTA based programs (CONFOR, KEY, DIST, INTKEY).

This tool provides an interactive, user-friendly interface to DELTA-format files as a real DELTA data entry/maintenance program. It is possible to insert or delete items, characters, and states, without having to worry about the consistency of the DELTA files. A database-like interface makes it easy to setup and maintain the main DELTA data files (ITEMS, CHARS and SPECS), as well as several of the DELTA directives files (TONAT, TOKEY, TODIS). A spreadsheet-like visualization facility for item and character data is also available.

It also makes possible to start all DELTA programs and create dichotomous keys for identification, natural-language descriptions, statistical reports, distance matrices, cluster and ordination analysis, etc., providing a viewer to look at and print the results (output files).

The Free Delta Editor is written in [FreePascal/Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/), a free, cross-platform object-oriented programming language for Rapid Application Development. Therefore, the program is platform-independent, and can run without modifications on any PC compatible with the x86 architecture, under GNU/Linux, MacOSX, and MS-Windows.

The Free Delta Editor is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
